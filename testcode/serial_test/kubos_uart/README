KUBOS_UART

This is an example program utilizing the rust_uart crate created by KubOS. The comms.rs file should be easily reusable into services or other programs.
The main.rs script shows the use of the comms.rs file, it prints anything received through the specified port to the console and then also sends a 
message reading "led" to the port every 5 seconds.
